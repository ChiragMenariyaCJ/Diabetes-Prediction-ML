# Diabetes-Prediction-ML

**Diabetes-Prediction-ML** is a full-stack machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health parameters. The project integrates a **Python-based backend** for ML predictions with a **user-friendly frontend** interface for interactive input and results.

## Features

* **Accurate Predictions:** Uses multiple ML algorithms (SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest) trained on real-world datasets.
* **Full-Stack Integration:** Backend API connects seamlessly with a responsive frontend interface.
* **User-Friendly UI:** Users can input health parameters like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc., and get instant prediction results.
* **Extensible:** Can be expanded to include more features like patient history tracking or additional datasets.

## Project Structure

```
/backend    → Python backend, ML models, data preprocessing
/frontend   → Frontend interface to interact with the ML models
README.md   → Project overview and instructions
```

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python, Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React
* **Database (Optional):** MySQL or SQLite for storing user data

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a **real-world application of machine learning in healthcare**. It is a valuable learning tool for understanding **data preprocessing, model training, backend API development, and frontend integration**.
