# Diabetes-Prediction-ML

**Diabetes-Prediction-ML** is a full-stack machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical input data. The project integrates a **Python-based backend** for data processing and model prediction with a **frontend interface** for user interaction.

## Features

* **Accurate Predictions:** Uses ML algorithms (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) trained on real-world datasets.
* **Full-Stack Integration:** Backend API connects seamlessly with a responsive frontend interface.
* **User-Friendly UI:** Users can input health parameters (age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.) and get instant prediction results.
* **Extensible:** Can be expanded to include more features like patient history tracking or dataset updates.

## Project Structure

```
/backend    → Python Flask/Django backend, ML model, API endpoints
/frontend   → React/HTML/CSS interface to interact with the ML model
README.md   → Project overview and instructions
```

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python, Flask/Django, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React
* **Database (Optional):** MySQL or SQLite for storing user data

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to `/backend` and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the backend server.
4. Navigate to `/frontend` and run the frontend application.
5. Open the web app in your browser and input patient data to get predictions.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a **real-world application of machine learning** in healthcare. It’s a great learning tool for understanding **data preprocessing, model training, API development, and frontend integration**.
